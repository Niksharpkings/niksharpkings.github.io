            <p class="about-me-inner">
          <br>
          Currently and intentionally, I'm building this profile website to demonstrate
          my ability to build a website from scratch and without any 3rd party
          site building tools or utilities. Currently this site is using only the vanilla HTML5,
          <abbr title="cascade style sheet">CSS3</abbr> and some JavaScript for the clock and user-agent info.
          I plan to integrate more
          javascript, bootstrap jquery, node.js packages, npm modules, and so
          on, in the future. <br><br>
          I will have and will soon post my React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and
          MongoDB projects that I've made here soon or in a few months from May 8, 2023 as
          this is the last time updated this GitPage site) with
          profiles/repos/projects/applications that does use javascript
          scripts, Api, SQL, Apollo, mongodb, CMS, redux, react, angular,
          ruby, C, C#, C++, python, graphql, yml, php, and so on, on to
          another GitHub page site.
          <br><br>
          Currently, I'm a full stack web developer, with new skills in
          python, java, c#, c++, c, dotnet, .net in development with the pro
          edition of codeAcademy.com with a passion for learning these new
          languages with an attempt to understand every little detail and
          syntax full and completely.
          <br><br>
          I was enrolled in the UCLA extension Full Stack Web Development
          Coding Bootcamp hosted by U2BootcampNetworks and have successfully
          gradated.
          <br><br>
          Currently, I have re-enrolled to Santa Monica College Spring 2023 to
          pursue a degree in Computer Programming Associate Degree and then I
          will transfer to CSUN to pursue a Bachelor's and Master Degree in
          Computer Programming.
          <br><br>
          I am not really trying to look for work at the moment as I'm ccommittingmyself to full time to
          achieve this master degree mission, but will be looking for maybe a
          part-time or full-time somewhere near brentwood, Los Angeles,
          California as I get more comfortable with my schooling
          and schedule.
          <br><br>
          In the mean time, I will be redoing all my assignments and projects as
          well as new ones as I progress in Codecademy and in my own personal
          interest and curiosity in mastering these diverse coding languages.
          <br><br>
          I am self-motivated, determinant, dedicated, and committed with
          diligence and composure in working hard with a passion for learning
          and problem solving my way into completing projects and resolving
          bugs and issues in my code to improve and develop my personal coding
          skills.
          <br><br>
          I am a fairly quick learner and a team player, but I do enjoy going
          slow when it comes to coding as it allows me to make less mistakes
          and understand or find better or innovative solution and techniques.
          <br><br>
          Naturally I'm a uniquely creative problem solver and designer and a
          good sport or team player when it comes down to it.
          <br><br>
          I want to further develop my technological skill sets by taking
          software development courses and learning the entire windows 10
          development process and azure, aws, heroku, and google cloud
          services as well as many language types there are at a controlled
          and gradual pace.
          <br><br>
          Ever since I owned a computer since I was 7 years of age, starting
          with an old windows 98 and ever since then I been interested in
          computer technology and how it works, but I never really got into
          programming until very recently as i figured i didn't really know
          where a good place to start was.
          <br><br>
          Spending most of my time behind a computer screen, I decided to stop
          being the consumer but to become the developer which is inspiring me
          to narrow down my life career path into web development, software
          development, network security, and business intelligence.
          <br><br>
          Special thanks to UCLAx-U2bootcampnetwork coding bootcamp got me
          started/ ball rolling n going into the right direction by helping me
          finally pick and choose a career that I'm willing to work for an
          have passion for.
