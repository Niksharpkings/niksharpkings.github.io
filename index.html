                Currently and intentionally build this very website to demonstrate my ability to build a website from
                scratch and without any 3rd party site building tools, templates, or libraries, frameworks, or any other, excluding
                bootstrap, jquery, node.js, npm modules, and so on. currently this site is using only the vanilla HTML5 and <abbr title="cascade style sheet">CSS3</abbr>.
                I plan to intergrate javascript, bootstrap jquery, node.js packages, npm modules, and so on, in the future.
                <br><br>
                I will have and will soon post my React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB project here soon
                (in a few months from March 8, 2023 as this is the last time updated this gitpage site) with profiles/repos/projects/applicaitons that does use
                javascript scripts, Api, SQL, Apollo, mongodb, CMS, redux, react, angular, ruby, c, C#, C++, python, graphql, yml, php, and so on, on to another GitHub page site.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I'm a full stack web developer, with new skills in python, java, c#, c++, c, dotnet, .net in
                development with the pro edition of codeAcademy.com with a passion for learning these new languages
                with an attempt to understand every little detail and syntax full and completely.
                <br><br>
                I was enrolled in the UCLA extension Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp hosted by
                U2BootcampNetworks and have successfully gradated.
                <br><br>
                Currently I have re-enrolled to Santa Monica College Spring 2023 to pursue a degree in Computer Programming Associate Degree
                and then I will transfer to CSUN to pursue a Bachelor's and Master Degree in Computer Programming.
                <br><br>
                I am not looking for a fwork as I'm commiting myself to full time to achive this master degree mission, but will be looking for
                maybe a part-time or full-time somewhere near brentwood, Los Angeles, California, but later as I get more confortable
                with my schooling and schedule.
                <br><br>
                In the mean time I will be redoing all myassignments and projects as well
                as new ones as I progress in Codecademy and in my own personal
                interest and curiosity in mastering these diverse coding languages.
                <br><br>
                I am self-motivated, determinant, dedicated, and commited with diligence and composure in working hard with a passion for
                learning and problem solving my way into completing projects and resolving bugs and issues in my code to improve and
                develop my personal coding skills.
                <br><br>
                I am a fairly quick learner and a team player, but I do enjoy going
                slow when it comes to coding as it allows me to make less mistakes and understand or find better or
                innovative solution and techniques.
                <br><br>
                Naturally I'm a uniquely creative problem solver and designer and a good sport or team player when it
                comes down to it.
                <br><br>
                I want to further develop my technological skill sets by taking software development courses and
                learning the entire windows 10 development process and azure, aws, heroku, and google cloud
                services as well as many language types there are at a controlled and gradual pace.
                <br><br>
                Ever since I owned a computer since I was 7 years of age, starting with an old windows 98 and ever
                since then I been interested in computer technology and how it works, but I never really got into
                programming until very recently as i figured i didn't really know where a good place to start was.
                <br><br>
                Spending most of my time behind a computer screen, I decided to stop being the consumer but to
                become the developer which is inspiring me to narrow down my life career path into web development,
                software development, network security, and business intelligence.
                <br><br>
                Special thanks to UCLAx-U2bootcampnetwork coding bootcamp got me started/ ball rolling n going into the right direction by
                helping me finally pick and choose a career that I'm willing to work for an have passion for.
