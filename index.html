            Currently and intentionally build this very website to demonstrate
            my ability to build a website from scratch and without any 3rd party
            site building tools, templates, or libraries, frameworks, or any
            other, excluding bootstrap, jquery, node.js, npm modules, and so on.
            currently this site is using only the vanilla HTML5 and
            <abbr title="cascade style sheet">CSS3</abbr>. I plan to intergrate
            javascript, bootstrap jquery, node.js packages, npm modules, and so
            on, in the future. <br><br>
            I will have and will soon post my React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and
            MongoDB project here soon (in a few months from March 8, 2023 as
            this is the last time updated this gitpage site) with
            profiles/repos/projects/applicaitons that does use javascript
            scripts, Api, SQL, Apollo, mongodb, CMS, redux, react, angular,
            ruby, c, C#, C++, python, graphql, yml, php, and so on, on to
            another GitHub page site.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I'm a full stack web developer, with new skills in
            python, java, c#, c++, c, dotnet, .net in development with the pro
            edition of codeAcademy.com with a passion for learning these new
            languages with an attempt to understand every little detail and
            syntax full and completely.
            <br><br>
            I was enrolled in the UCLA extension Full Stack Web Development
            Coding Bootcamp hosted by U2BootcampNetworks and have successfully
            gradated.
            <br><br>
            Currently I have re-enrolled to Santa Monica College Spring 2023 to
            pursue a degree in Computer Programming Associate Degree and then I
            will transfer to CSUN to pursue a Bachelor's and Master Degree in
            Computer Programming.
            <br><br>
            I am not looking for a fwork as I'm commiting myself to full time to
            achive this master degree mission, but will be looking for maybe a
            part-time or full-time somewhere near brentwood, Los Angeles,
            California, but later as I get more confortable with my schooling
            and schedule.
            <br><br>
            In the mean time I will be redoing all myassignments and projects as
            well as new ones as I progress in Codecademy and in my own personal
            interest and curiosity in mastering these diverse coding languages.
            <br><br>
            I am self-motivated, determinant, dedicated, and commited with
            diligence and composure in working hard with a passion for learning
            and problem solving my way into completing projects and resolving
            bugs and issues in my code to improve and develop my personal coding
            skills.
            <br><br>
            I am a fairly quick learner and a team player, but I do enjoy going
            slow when it comes to coding as it allows me to make less mistakes
            and understand or find better or innovative solution and techniques.
            <br><br>
            Naturally I'm a uniquely creative problem solver and designer and a
            good sport or team player when it comes down to it.
            <br><br>
            I want to further develop my technological skill sets by taking
            software development courses and learning the entire windows 10
            development process and azure, aws, heroku, and google cloud
            services as well as many language types there are at a controlled
            and gradual pace.
            <br><br>
            Ever since I owned a computer since I was 7 years of age, starting
            with an old windows 98 and ever since then I been interested in
            computer technology and how it works, but I never really got into
            programming until very recently as i figured i didn't really know
            where a good place to start was.
            <br><br>
            Spending most of my time behind a computer screen, I decided to stop
            being the consumer but to become the developer which is inspiring me
            to narrow down my life career path into web development, software
            development, network security, and business intelligence.
            <br><br>
            Special thanks to UCLAx-U2bootcampnetwork coding bootcamp got me
            started/ ball rolling n going into the right direction by helping me
            finally pick and choose a career that I'm willing to work for an
            have passion for.
