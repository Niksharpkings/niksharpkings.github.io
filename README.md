# Ńἱĸἱ৳α "Ńἱĸ" Shârρἱo's Profile / Project / Resume Page

## Welcome to my personal profile page hosted by Github & Github-pages. (currently under revamped development and construction)

### Important NOTE :

```
	This profile webpage is undergoing reconstruction and development. Currently, I'm pursuing for a Computer Science Associate Degree while in hopes of reaching a transfer to a UCSU in aim of a Bachelor's and/or Master Degree in Computer Programming. I am also, taking certificate course at codecademy.com and revamping/redoing all my UCLAx-U2 coding bootcamp projects as there is a lot of depreciations, expired  free-trial features, and missing or over-rushed features and lots of tunings, tweakings, and optimizations needed. I plan to finish the revamp/redoing off all the UCLAx-U2 projects/modules one year...
