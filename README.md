# Ńἱĸἱ৳α "Ńἱĸ" Shârρἱo's Profile / Project / Resume Page

## Welcome to my personal profile page hosted by Github & Github-pages. (currently under revamped development and construction)

### Important NOTE :

```
	This Site is still undergoing reconstruction and development and I will be updating it by the upcoming months. I am currently over flooded with new school assignments as I recently re-enrolled to Santa Monica College Spring 2023 to pursue a degree in Computer Programming Associate Degree and then I will transfer to CSUN to pursue a Bachelor's and Master Degree in Computer Programming. I am also, taking certificate course at codecademy.com and revamping/redoing all my UCLAx-U2 coding bootcamp projects as there is a lot of deprications, expired  free-trial features, and missing or over-rushed features and lots of tuning, tweaking, and optimaztion  need.  I plan to  finish the revamp/redoing off all the UCLAx-U2 projects/modules by the end of 2023.
