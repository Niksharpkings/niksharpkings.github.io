hello everyone uh so I wanted to talk a little bit about our first essay so really when we were looking at the first essay we have two main things to do
 
 first thing is identify the author's
 
 theme
 
 so when you're going over theme in the
 
 module you'll notice that
 
 when we're talking about theme we're
 
 really looking at their point or their
 
 main idea so for example
 
 if we look at one of the stories and we
 
 think that the subject is love like this
 
 this poem the story is about love
 
 then what we're going to do is look at
 
 what the actual text is saying about
 
 love right so that when we look at theme
 
 it's like what is the message about the
 
 author's subject okay so the first thing
 
 I would do in terms of theme is try to
 
 identify the subject of the poem and
 
 then try to figure out what the author
 
 is trying to say about that subject
 
 the next part of what we're going to be
 
 doing
 
 is then taking that and looking at how
 
 the author is utilizing different
 
 literary devices to communicate that
 
 message
 
 and so
 
 in terms of the structure and you can
 
 see some of the samples I have if you
 
 want to go ahead a little bit in the
 
 module and a lot of what folks do
 
 sometimes is have their body paragraphs
 
 focused on a particular literary device
 
 and then talk about how that author is
 
 utilizing that literary device to
 
 communicate their message whatever that
 
 message may be so in terms of this class
 
 that's what I would focus on
 
 is utilizing the subject of the poem to
 
 help you figure out what the message is
 
 and then from there go and look at what
 
 literary devices are being used to help
 
 communicate that message
 
 if you have any questions about the
 
 essay please let me know one of the
 
 things you'll notice is that the class
 
 discussions and also reading quiz is all
 
 designed to help you get started on that
 
 essay and to understand it a little bit
 
 more clearly but if you're having
 
 struggle you know a struggles trying to
 
 put things together let me know so I
 
 could help you all right thank you very much have a good day
