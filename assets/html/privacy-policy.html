        The site is provided on an "as-is" and "as available" basis, and company

      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
        the above exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions do not
        allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
        limitation may not apply to you.

        consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages

      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability

      <h3>Copyright Policy.</h3>
      <p>
        Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users
        of our Site do the same. In connection with our Site, we have adopted
        and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the
        removal of any infringing materials and for the termination of users of
        our online Site who are repeated infringers of intellectual property
        rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is,
        through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a
        work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the
        following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to
        17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
        <li>
          identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been
          infringed;
        </li>
        <li>
          identification of the material on our services that you claim is
          infringing and that you request us to remove;
        </li>
        <li>
          sufficient information to permit us to locate such material; your
          address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
        </li>
        <li>
          a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
          objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
          agent, or under the law; and
        </li>
        <li>
          a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
          under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the
          copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized
          to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f), any misrepresentation
        of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the
        complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorneyâ€™s
        fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
        allegation of copyright infringement.
      </p>
      <h3>General:</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any
        substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the
        last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting
        notice of the changes on our Site. You are responsible for providing us
        with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail
        address that you have provided us is not valid our dispatch of the
        e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
        notice of the changes described in the notice. Any changes to these
        Terms will be effective upon the earliest of thirty (30) calendar days
        following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30)
        calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our
        Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our
        Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall
        indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound
        by the terms and conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please
        read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract
        with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
        MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in
        connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided
        by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims
        court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis
        under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed
        to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This
        Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
        subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
        successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users
        or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party
        may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a
        written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim
        or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be
        sent to: 55 Main Street, Some Town, CA, 12345. After the Notice is
        received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
        dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or
        dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either
        party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement
        offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
        after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which
        either party is entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American
        Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution
        provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is
        not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
        alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all
        aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in
        conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing
        the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
        arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award
        sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
        resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
        of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total
        amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
        or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
        Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
        residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless
        the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the
        arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time
        and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
        the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
        settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of
        arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
        $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising
        out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
        costs of the ADR Provider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance
        based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by
        telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the
        specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
        The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
        or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration
        action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
        limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
        pertinent claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
        will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the
        dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with
        any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
        grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
        shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
        non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
        applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue
        a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has
        the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge
        in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
        binding upon you and the Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
        STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
        A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
        by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures
        are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules
        applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
        In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in
        any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
        award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
        TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes within
        the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated
        on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than
        one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or
        consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be
        strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
        unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a
        party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to
        enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek
        injunctive or equitable relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
        found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no
        force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement
        shall continue in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in
        this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
        claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
        portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
        termination of your relationship with Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company
        may bring an individual action in small claims court.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek
        emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to
        maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
        measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations
        under this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims
        of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
        infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâ€™s patent,
        copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this
        Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits
        the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to
        the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands
        County, California, for such purposes.
