                  Name:<br></strong> <br>My full name is Nikita Sharpio or Mikita Sharpio, I&rsquo;m 32 years of age
                and my race, color, religion, ethnicity, gender is all equal to human, nothing more and/or nothing less
                than human, okay. Actually, I consider myself as an <a
                  href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Angeleno">Angeleno</a> human. Oh, and yes, I do have
                two legitimate names, Nikita is my US passport name and Mikita is my European passport name. How is that
                possible you might ask or how it happened? Well, I can't recall exactly, but I moved to the USA (Los
                Angeles, Brentwood) at age 4. While getting registered officially either before I was a&nbsp; US citizen
                (Social Security Administration) or most likely at immigration border control at LAX, some government or
                federal agent might have taken the letter "M" as an "N" as I assume. Therefore I have two legal names
                that I can go by. However, I prefer Nik or even Nikki as my nephew would shout out, endlessly.
                Basically, I go by many names, but you can most definitely call me by any of these names: Nikita, Nik,
                Nikki, Mik, Mikki, Nick, Mick, Niky, Nicky, Miky, just not Micky, or by last name Sharpio (not to be
                confused with Shapiro, which happens often). I'll take anyone of those names, to your liking.&nbsp;

              <br><strong> Major/Career:</strong><br>As far as my major/career goals are, I am pursuing a major of
              an associate degree in computer science here at SMC, but plan to transfer over with the associates degree
              to CSUN next fall for a bachelors and/or masters in computer science. <br><br><img

                alt="Nik With a Huge Statue" width="447" height="335"> <br><br>I originally enrolled in SMC in
              fall 2010, right after highschool, as a part time student. I dropped out of SMC after spring 2017 because
              back then there there were way more requirements to do, with 3-5 years of math still needed to be
              completed. I did really badly on my placement exam that put me in a really low level: math 31 (plain
              geometry) and English 81A. In July 2012 I got a web tester/troubleshooter internship job at American
              Apparel. I hustled really hard and made a good impression with the loss prevention (LP) or asset
              protection (AP) team and boss. I was promoted and transferred to be their online fraud investigator,
              coordinator, warehouse key holder, LP or AP in November 2012. I stayed there until the company went
              bankrupt due to the CEO's negligence. I remained in SMC till spring 2017 because it was taking way too
              long and I had to find work. Macy's (Beverly Center) Loss Prevention Agent from March 2018 to July 2018.
              After Macy&rsquo;s I went into the networks of private security for Riot Games (Santa Monica) and NBC
              universal (Studio City) as a 3rd party affiliate for some time until I was promoted to be under the wing
              of the Vice President of the company I was with. There I was working for The Burbank Studio&rsquo;s (
              mainly at Blizzard Entertainment, Iheartradio, and nickelodeon). Later on, from July 2018 - I was promoted
              again had the opportunity to work at FOX 11 Studios (Los Angeles), Fox Sports (Los Angeles), and Amazon
              Studios (Santa Monica at the Water Garden) until June 2019&nbsp; where I ended up leaving the private
              security company. Later on,&nbsp; from August 2019 - January 2020 I worked as an Ambassador for Westwood
              Village, but the pay wasn&rsquo;t good and it was not what I expected or wanted to do as a job or career.
              So, I thought to my self, their must be a better way... <br><br><img

                alt="Money Man Nik" width="449" height="336"> <br><br>Ah ha! Let me try going back to school, but
              it was a long road if I went back to SMC to feel like I was in a sand trap for life. <br>Eventually, I
              enrolled into a trade school, LAORT for AutoCad Drafting and Design, but after one month the school closed
              down due to the entire school losing their Financial Aid eligibility and covid-19 hit. <br>I took
              unemployment and waited out the covid-19, national wide boarded up riot storm,&nbsp; and nonstop chaotic
              unfortunately events. In December 2021,&nbsp; after talking to a very successfully Business Owner, I was
              encouraged to enrolled into&nbsp; UCLAx as certified Full-Stack Web Developer where I became their alumni
              as of June 2022. <br><br><img
                src="/users/42162/files/17065754/preview?verifier=XHDgrftAAcfMabdivtWRG7ObMjFJ5FKbvjcOhgTH"
                alt="UCLAx Certificate" width="499" height="382"> <br><br>However, I learned over time and long
              contemplation that I simply don't want to deal with the "world" wide web, hence ("world"), due to extreme
              work/job scenario that pressure you to short and unsuspected heavy/stressful deadlines and unrealistic
              expectations to meet quotes end. However, I rather do software or some internal/private-corporation
              programming or some type of coding where the pressure isn&rsquo;t as viewer/critic intensive or with short
              and hectic deadlines and near or impossible expectation of job task environment, as it is very common in
              the website development world. This is why I have returned to SMC in Spring 2023 and found that I had to
              do less requirements, two or less years worth. Currently, I only have 3 classes to take to transfer to
              CSUN in the Fall 2025 semester and 3 additional computer science classes to get my Associates.&nbsp;

              <br><strong>Technical Background: </strong> <br><br>I skateboard everywhere I go. I haven&rsquo;t
              had a car since covid-19 and I love it more than anything, after a few months without one.&nbsp; Not
              having to pay for a car, gas, maintenance, insurance, or even drive people around, finding parking, etc.
              is amazing. At first it was difficult not having a car, but it made me much healthier and everything is
              local anyways. I really don't want to have any sort of vehicle that has to be registered and
              maintained.&nbsp; Other than that, I like to play video games, but with school and other commitments, I
              haven't had a good chance to play video games in a few years. Although, when I do have time, I usually
              work on my <a href="https://github.com/Niksharpkings?tab=repositories">Github Repository profile</a> or
              try to learn a new computer language or computer skill set, or build/improve on top of it.

                <br><strong> A Memorable Summer Experience: </strong> <br><br>A memorable summer experience that
                I've had was when I went to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico when I was a young lad or young teenager for
                vacation at an all inclusive resort. It was very memorable as I remember one night their was a massive
                thunderstorm, but the clouds where far away and not so thick. I was able to look as far as you can to
                the left and right of the ocean, only darkness was far far a head. I remember feeling the humidity
                rising so high that I started to feel the static electricity building up all over my body, it was a very
                interesting and amazing feeling that I can never forget. It started pour or drizzle a little bit in the
                pitch darkness by the beachside, by the water. No matter where I looked their was lighting boom and
                roaring in all direction at the same time. I just remember look out their into the abyss as if zuzes was
                throwing out a spectacular and physically sensational mastershow unlike nothing I've ever seen from
                nature. I had my family in my eye site and just pure awe. Probability, the most intrinsic and enticing
                moment I've ever had experienced in my life.</p>
