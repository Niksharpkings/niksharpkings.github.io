        This website is built from scratch using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In the future, I plan to integrate more JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and other technologies.
        <br><br>
        Soon, I will showcase my projects involving React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and more. This site will be updated with various projects and applications in the months to come.
        <br><br>
        I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with skills in Python, Java, C#, C++, and .NET, continuously learning through Codecademy (paused) and Santa Monica College (as of 2025).
        <br><br>
        I graduated from the UCLA Extension Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and am currently pursuing a Computer Science Associate Degree at Santa Monica College, with plans to transfer for a Bachelor's and Master's degree.
        <br><br>
        While focusing on my studies, I may seek part-time or full-time work in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California.
        <br><br>
        I am dedicated, determined, committed with diligence, self-motivated, composed at discretion, and passionate about learning and problem-solving. I enjoy both team collaboration and independent work, aiming to improve my coding skills and develop innovative solutions.
        <br><br>
        My goal is to enhance my technological skills through software development courses and learning about coding development platforms such as Microsoft Windows, Azure, AWS, Heroku, and Google Cloud services.
        <br><br>
        My interest in computer technology began at age 7, and I have since transitioned from being a consumer to a developer, focusing on web development, software development, network security, and business intelligence.
        <br><br>
        Special thanks to the UCLAx-U2bootcampnetwork for guiding me towards a fulfilling career in technology.
