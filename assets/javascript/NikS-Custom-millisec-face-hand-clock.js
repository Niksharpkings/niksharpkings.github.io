      suppliers be liable to you or any third-party for any lost profits, lost

      contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any damages arising
      from or related to this agreement, will at all times be limited to a
      maximum of fifty U.S. dollars (u.s. $50). The existence of more than one

      agreement.
    
    
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability

    Copyright Policy.
    
      Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users
      of our Site do the same. In connection with our Site, we have adopted
      and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the
      removal of any infringing materials and for the termination of users of
      our online Site who are repeated infringers of intellectual property
      rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of our users is,
      through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a
      work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the
      following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to
      17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
    
    
      your physical or electronic signature;
      
        identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been
        infringed;
      
      
        identification of the material on our services that you claim is
        infringing and that you request us to remove;
      
      
        sufficient information to permit us to locate such material; your
        address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
      
      
        a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
        objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
        agent, or under the law; and
      
      
        a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
        under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the
        copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized
        to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      
    </ul>
    
      Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. Â§ 512(f), any misrepresentation
      of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the
      complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorneys
      fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
      allegation of copyright infringement.
    
    General:
    
      These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any
      substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the
      last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting
      notice of the changes on our Site. You are responsible for providing us
      with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail
      address that you have provided us is not valid our dispatch of the
      e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective
      notice of the changes described in the notice. Any changes to these
      Terms will be effective upon the earliest of thirty (30) calendar days
      following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30)
      calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our
      Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our
      Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall
      indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound
      by the terms and conditions of such changes. Dispute Resolution. Please
      read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract
      with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
      MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
    
    
      Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in
      connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided
      by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims
      court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis
      under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed
      to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This
      Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
      subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
      successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users
      or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
    
    
      Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party
      may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a
      written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim
      or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be
      sent to: 55 Main Street, Some Town, CA, 12345. After the Notice is
      received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or
      dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or
      dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either
      party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement
      offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until
      after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which
      either party is entitled.
    
    
      Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American
      Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution
      provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is
      not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
      alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all
      aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in
      conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing
      the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at
      1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
      arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award
      sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
      resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
      of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total
      amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00)
      or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
      Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
      residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless
      the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the
      arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time
      and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by
      the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If
      the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
      settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of
      arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or
      $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising
      out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
      costs of the ADR Provider.
    
    
      Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance
      based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by
      telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the
      specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
      The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties
      or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
    
    
      Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration
      action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
      limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
      pertinent claim.
    
    
      Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
      will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the
      dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with
      any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
      grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
      shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
      non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
      applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue
      a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
      findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has
      the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge
      in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
      binding upon you and the Company.
    
    
      Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
      STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
      A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
      by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures
      are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules
      applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
      In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in
      any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
      award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
      TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
    
    
      Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes within
      the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated
      on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than
      one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or
      consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
    
    
      Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be
      strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
      unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a
      party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to
      enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek
      injunctive or equitable relief.
    
    
      Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
      found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
      competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no
      force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement
      shall continue in full force and effect.
    
    
      Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in
      this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
      claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
      portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
    
    
      Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
      termination of your relationship with Company.
    
    
      Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company
      may bring an individual action in small claims court.
    
    
      Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek
      emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to
      maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim
      measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations
      under this Arbitration Agreement.
    
    
      Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims
      of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
      infringement or misappropriation of the other partys patent,
      copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this
      Arbitration Agreement.
    
    
      In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits
      the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to
      the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands
      County, California, for such purposes.
    
    
      The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject
      to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to
      export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S.
      technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such
      data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
    
    
      Company is located at the address in Section 10.8. If you are a
      California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint
      Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California
      Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R
      Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
    
    
      Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Company
      use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or
      whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via
      email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive
      communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that
      all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other
      communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any
      legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in
      a hard copy writing.
    
    
      Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you
      and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce
      any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of
      such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for
      convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word
      "including" means "including without limitation". If any provision of
      these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions
      of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable
      provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to
      the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is
      that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or
      partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations
      herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise
      transferred by you without Companys prior written consent, and any
      attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation
      of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these
      Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be
      binding upon assignees.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
